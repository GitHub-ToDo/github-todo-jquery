<h2>Information</h2>

By Matthew Yang & Amy Kang

<h2>Description</h2>

Our goal on this project was the take the existing jQuery Todo list example and modify it so it would fetch and update github issues. We were able to accomplish this by accessing the Github API and using Ajax to update the issue state.
